# Dataset
As our malicious dataset is private, we can't attach it to our github. The benign apps can be found in https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/126Y5mbgHEAQdqXRwrom-UT2R9mgT_VQS?usp=sharing

# Source code
We uploaded the code for our attacks and for the functionality and maliciousness tests. We also uploaded two classifiers we used - Kirin and PB_AMD. For Drebin, visit https://github.com/MLDroid/drebin. The FAMOUS classifier's code is private. Therefore, we could not add its code.
